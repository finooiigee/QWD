This is a page of soundbite opinions regarding the anime I've seen since June 19th 2023,
they are not intended to be thorough reviews and do not fully represent my feelings.<br>
At the moment the scores are completely arbitrary - it'd be most useful to think of these
scores as an  average  of how much  I enjoyed  each show, a  multi-axis judgement  of its
technical components, and the likelihood of me  recommending  it to a friend.

In spite of the compelling storytelling and universe it fails to deliver on the potential
of its brilliant themes and resonant ideas due to an  amiss in focus  and   insubstantial
characters. It isn't anything greater than the sum of its parts.<br>
Watching 'From the New World' is like listening to a friend clumsily recall a great show.

Horrible pacing - read the manga instead.
