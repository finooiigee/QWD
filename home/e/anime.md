This is a page of soundbite opinions regarding the anime I've seen since June 19th 2023, they are not intended to be thorough reviews and do not fully represent my feelings.

At the moment<sub>19/06/23</sub> the scores are completely arbitrary. It'd be most useful to think of these scores as an average of how much I enjoyed each show, a multi-axis judgement of its technical components, and the likelihood of me recommending it to a friend.

In spite of the compelling storytelling and universe it fails to deliver on its potentially brilliiant themes and reasonant ideas due to an amiss in focus and insubstantial characters. As such, it isn't anything greater than the sum of its parts.
