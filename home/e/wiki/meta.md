# Structure

Entries on the wiki are self-contained - some thoroughly cover a topic, some are broad and abstract, others are collections of links alongside their descriptions. Whatever their content, the structure and style of pages is mostly consistent - with special exceptions.

At the beginning of each page is a section enumerating associated or relevant information about the entry, for example, in an entry about `Baker's Percentage` that section may resemble:

```
# Baker's Percentage

Index:Bread|Formula
Index;ChainBaker

```

Pages are composed of sections that are shown visually in outlined blocks. At the beginning of each section is a title labelling its scope. Sections can contain subsections that are noted by a new title displayed with a smaller font size.

Abstractly, the wiki's organization structure aims to be tree-like.
