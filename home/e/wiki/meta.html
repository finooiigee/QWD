<h1>Structure</h1>
<p>Entries on the wiki are self-contained - some thoroughly cover a topic, some are broad and abstract, others are collections of links alongside their descriptions. Whatever their content, the structure and style of pages is mostly consistent - with special exceptions.</p>
<p>At the beginning of each page is a section enumerating associated or relevant information about the entry, for example, in an entry about <code>Baker's Percentage</code> that section may resemble:</p>
<pre><code># Baker's Percentage

Index:Bread|Formula
Index;ChainBaker

</code></pre>
<p>Pages are composed of <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>s that are shown visually in outlined blocks. At the beginning of each section is a title labelling its scope. Sections can contain subsections that are noted by a new title displayed with a smaller font size.</p>
<p>Abstractly, the wiki's organization structure aims to be tree-like.</p>
