<p>hi! this is a page in a website in the internet.  click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">here</a> to learn more about the internet.</p>
<p>this page, like every page in the internet, has a topic or purpose. im not sure what the topic or purpose of this page is, but im not too sure which</p>
<p>ah yes</p>
<h1>hii</h1>
<p>this is web  site by person known usually as "taswelll" and also "selaere" in some places for some reason. i exist and code sometimes and do other uninteresting things</p>
<p></p>
<p>uh</p>
<p> well you see websites usually have links. these links mean that you can go to OTHER website just by using your pointer device and pointing it on the blue text you find. like the thing you clicked earlier to learn more about the internet! yea here are some more</p>
<h1>links</h1>

<p>you see i am part of the very elusive secret "<a href="/">QWD</a>" collective <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_composition">compose</a>d of very cool people you should go look at <a href="/home">their webpages</a> they are cool</p>

<p>i made a minesweeper clone and i think it's funny you should go <a href="./mwvc.html">play it</a></p>

<p>i also have another website with some unfinished bad stuff::  <a href="https://selaere.github.io/">selaere.github.io</a></p>
