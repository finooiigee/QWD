        Henlo, this is olus2000 AKA Aleksander Sabak AKA Truffle. I like
        programming, but only some parts of it. One part I enjoy <b>very
        much</b> is the <a href=https://concatenative.org>concatenative
        paradigm</a>, which is why my first project to be hosted here is the
        <a href=../concat-eval.html>concatenatve calculus evaluator</a>, a tool
        for interactively playing with concatenative calculus.

        <h3>Programming language is a tool for thought</h3>
